The main.cpp file is not the one we should use for the final compile,
but it is easiest to use when testing the program since it is a single
file. Once done testing on it, copy/paste the sections back into the
individual files.

Currently, the full program is not running, because of a logic error in
the sortHandfunction, where runs are not properly sorted. There is some
output from the main function to help find the error, but it is nothing
permanent.
